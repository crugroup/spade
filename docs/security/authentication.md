# Authentication

The initial version of Spade supports username and password authentication. We plan to add more authentication methods in the future.

### JWT token

You can call `api/v1/token` to get a JWT token, which can next be used to interact directly with spade APIs.
Full Swagger API documentation is available at `/` of Spade backend for authenticated users.
