# Spade SDK package
The **Spade SDK** is a Python package containing type definitions for all of the objects needed
to develop with Spade, without having to import the entire application into your dependencies.
We've built it to be very simple, and only depend on the standard Python library.

It can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install spadesdk
```
