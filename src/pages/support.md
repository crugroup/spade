# Support

We build Spade as an internal tool to power business critical processes at CRU. We are sharing it with the community in the hope that it will be useful to others. We are committed to maintaining and improving Spade, and we welcome contributions from the community. However, as an internal tool, at present it does not have a fixed release schedule or a dedicated support team.

We will respond to issues and pull requests as quickly as we can.

To report a bug, request a feature, ask a question or make a contribution, please use standard GitHub features such as issues and pull requests, against the following repositories:

- [Spade](https://github.com/crugroup/spade)
- [Spade UI](https://github.com/crugroup/spade-ui)
- [Spade Helm Chart](https://github.com/crugroup/spade-helm)
